### ✅ Good to Know

- **First use might be slow:** The app "wakes up" and takes 30-60 seconds the first time each day
- **Stay on the page:** Don't close the app while converting
- **Check your downloads:** After "Download complete!" appears, check your Downloads folder
- **Can convert 20 per hour:** There's a limit to prevent abuse, but 20 is plenty!

### 🎯 Best Practices

- ✅ Keep your password private

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid password"
- Check you typed it correctly
- Passwords are case-sensitive (Capital letters matter!)
- Ask your family member for the password again

### "Invalid YouTube URL"
- Make sure you copied the full link
- The link should start with `https://youtube.com` or `https://youtu.be`
- Try copying the link again from YouTube

### "Conversion failed"
- Some videos can't be downloaded (restricted, private, or live streams)
- Try a different video to test
- Check your internet connection
- Wait a few minutes and try again

### Can't find the downloaded file
- **iPhone:** Check Files app → Downloads
- **Android:** Check Files or Downloads app
- Try downloading again

### App is very slow
- First use of the day is always slower (30-60 seconds)
- After that it should be faster
- Make sure you have good internet connection

### "Too many requests"
- You hit the 20 per hour limit
- Wait an hour and try again
- The limit resets every hour
